### Stress -- Key to Understand English
#### Word Stressed
[Dictionary](https://www.learnersdictionary.com/)
#### Sentence Stressed
Generally, we stress nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, WH-words, and negative words (e.g., “no,” “not,” “can’t”).  They always have a beat—they are longer, louder, and higher.  These words are called “content” words. 
On the other hand, we do not stress prepositions, pronouns, articles, modals and auxiliaries (e.g., can, should, have, be).  These words are reduced, unclear, often difficult to hear, and they are shorter, softer, and lower than stressed words. These words are called “structure” words.
