### Stress -- Key to Understand English
#### Word Stressed (1 syllabel)
- [Dictionary](https://www.learnersdictionary.com/)
- Compound Nouns: 1st stressed. network, coffee cup.
- Compound Proper Nouns: last stressed. Newyork city. The Golden Gate Bridge.
- Nouns and Verbs: Nouns-first, verbs-2nd. record, keep a record. present.
- Suffixes: -ity, -ion, -ic, -ical, -ian. change the stressed.
- Many nouns/adjectives and verbs look almost alike, but nouns are one word and verbs are two words. Stress Two-Word Verbs (Compound Verbs) on the 2nd Word 
BREAKup - break UP, PICKup - pick UP,HANDout - hand OUT, TAKEoff - take OFF 
#### Sentence Stressed
Generally, we stress nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, WH-words, and negative words (e.g., “no,” “not,” “can’t”).  They always have a beat—they are longer, louder, and higher.  These words are called “content” words. 
On the other hand, we do not stress prepositions, pronouns, articles, modals and auxiliaries (e.g., can, should, have, be).  These words are reduced, unclear, often difficult to hear, and they are shorter, softer, and lower than stressed words. These words are called “structure” words.
